Lab1 Program Description by Cameron Morrison and Andrew Simonds

The objective of the program was to return the name, status, user ID, and group ID for all processes running at the time of execution.

At the start of the main function the output file is opened in write only mode. 
A header line is printed containing all the information that will be read from the proc file. 
A dirent struct is created to contain the names of the processes. Scandir is used to put the name of each file in the proc
folder into the namelist struct, calling upon isProcessDir to only grab processes (file names consisting only of integers).  
The function isProcessDir iterates through the name of the dirent process passed to it, to ensure that
each character is a digit, and returns a zero or a one accordingly.  A for loop is used to iterate through namelist which
obtains the name, status, user ID and group ID of each process.  In each iteration, the corresponding name list
file’s properties are saved to predeclared variables of the same size.  These characteristics are modified using 
functions such as delLast() to replace unwanted newline characters with an escape character, firstChar() to
remove the extra label at the start of the property’s string, and deleteAfter() which deletes the duplicates 
in the group ID and user ID strings by replacing a tab with an escape character to truncate the string where needed. 
Once the strings are obtained and properly formatted, they are written to the output file in a table format.
