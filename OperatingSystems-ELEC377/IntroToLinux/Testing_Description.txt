Lab1 Testing by Cameron Morrison and Andrew Simonds

To test the program, the output.txt file was compared to the output of the ‘top’ command in linux. 
This command printed all the information in the /proc file including each process name, status, 
and user ID. Each user ID from the top command was shown as a name which was then converted into an 
integer and checked against the integer IDs in the output file. All of the names and statuses of
the processes matched the output file both in content and format, however the top command didn’t
give the Group ID property for the processes. To supplement ‘top’ we used 
“grep ‘^Gid’ /proc/<process number>/status” on each process to test its Gid against our results.
