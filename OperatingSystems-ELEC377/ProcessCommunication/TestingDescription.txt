Lab3 Testing Description by Cameron Morrison and Andrew Simonds

The first step of the testing process was to run the meminit program to initialize the shared memory segment.  The command was ./meminit.

We then tested our producer and consumer programs together.

Our first set of tests consisted of us manually inputting text to be taken in by the producer.
This text was then observed to be written out to the console.
The commands used for this were "./producer 0" "<user-input text>"  and then in separate console "./consumer 1"

The next set of tests were to give an input file to the producer instead of manual input, and then observe the output by the consumer.
The commands used for this were "./producer 0 < test0.txt"  and then in separate console "./consumer 1"

Lastly, we ran two producer programs at once, with two different input files, and then the consumer program.
We observed that the consumer was able to receive the data from the producers in the desired order and with no errors.
This can be observed in testOut.txt.
The command used for this were "./producer 0 < test1.txt" in one console, "./producer 1 < test2.txt" in a separate console "./consumer 1 >> testOut.txt" in the third console.
