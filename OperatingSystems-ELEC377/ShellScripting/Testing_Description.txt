Script 1:

For script one testing was done by running the provided command "ps -eo pid,user,rss,args". This was compared to
the output in script1Output.txt. The first script was written with the intention of displaying 
the same information as the ps command in the same format. The outputs were exactly the same minus the last
process; the ps command displayed a ps process, and the script displayed the process for the running script.

Script 2:
The 2nd script was ran in multiple folders that each contained either one of the two key file types, main and module, or a
directory containing absolutely nothing to test that boundary case.

The script was ran in the Lab2(module lab) directory and found the correct number of each file: 0 main, 1 module (with 0 of the corresponding prints
, and the rest under 'other'.
The output was piped into the Lab2Output.txt using 'sh Script1.sh /home/student/E377-Thu-19/lab2 >> Lab2Output.txt

The script was ran in the Lab3 directory and in this case it also found the correct number of each file type: 3 main with the corresponding prints,
0 module, and the rest 'other'.
The output was piped into the Lab3Output.txt using 'sh Script1.sh /home/student/E377-Thu-19/lab3 >> Lab3Output.txt

Lastly, an empty folder was created in lab4 using 'mkdir Empty'. The script was ran in this folder and displayed the correct
output; showcasing that there were none of any file type.
The output was piped into the EmptyOutput.txt using 'sh Script1.sh /home/student/E377-Thu-19/lab4/Empty >> EmptyOutput.txt
