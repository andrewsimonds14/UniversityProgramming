top commands : all nice values line up, all PID are right,
check that uid matches user output from top
ps: ps shows the processes running; number lined up with output

The first step in testing the lab2 module was to run the command:
ps -l -A
which outup all running processes, and their PIDs, UIDs, and nice 
values. 

This was compared to the output in output.txt which was created by 
inserting our lab2 module in root using:
insmod lab2.o
and then running:
cat /proc/lab2 

Comparing the two, and referencing documentation to ensure numbers
== names for PID and UID, the testing showed that our module was outputing
the correct values.
